#### What is toy-mqtt?
This is a mqtt-broker written by a tyro in Mqtt.
I borrowed a lot of codes from [iot-mqtt-server](https://gitee.com/recallcode/iot-mqtt-server/paas/huaweicloud_cse).

#### Introduction
1. The project is based on maven
2. Implement most mqtt stuffs via Java netty
3. Use springboot for injections and configs

#### Run
`cd broker`<br>
`mvn spring-boot:run`<br>
 Server is running on port 1883.
